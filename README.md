# BattleShip

**ABSTRACT**

As the group project for Laboratory practice module, we were supposed to build an intelligent system which is able to play battleship game with another intelligent system. Battleship bot is a very popular board game where two players are given naval fleets, each player&#39;s objective being to sink all the ships of the opposing navy.

We were supposed to make microcontroller based decision making system to play battleship with other groups&#39; implementations.

We decided to design the schematic using Proteus software and the PIC software and used PIC microcontroller PIC16F877A to accomplish the target. MPLAB was used to program the PIC. Further Proteus 8.0 was used to simulate the circuits.

Initially we started by designing the schematic first. Next step was to check the schematic with the codes. We had to make several changes in the codes for it to work properly then we developed this circuit on the proto board. We used the generated hex file to simulate the corresponding schematic diagram in Proteus Professional 8, to check if our component worked and if the code we had come up with worked.

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Target**

Our aim is to build an intelligent system which is able to play battleship board game with another intelligent system.

**1.2 Design**

We referred to some of the tutorials in internet to get a rough idea of how the components were placed. Once we understood the material, we designed the schematic.

  1. **Scientific Literature**

By the time we started this project we did not have any idea about programming in MPLAB and designing circuits in Proteus. First we started practicing codes in MPLAB and designing circuits in Proteus and simulating them using Proteus. Then we studied about PIC microcontrollers and designed circuit in the bread board with a sample code running in MPLAB. Later on we were able to expand it to the proper code.

- **Microcontroller :**

One of the most popular controlling systems due to its low cost, simple power requirements and the ability to be programmed using simple software and hardware interface. Once programmed microcontroller acts like a mini computer. There is a wide range of microcontrollers serving different interfacing capabilities.

**2. Methods**

**2.1 List of components used**

2.1.1 Main Circuit

- PIC 16F877A Microcontroller
- 7 segment display
- Female-Female Jumpers
- 8MHz crystal oscillator
- 2 - 20pF ceramic capacitor
- 10K resistor
- 330 resistors (17)
- 3 – LEDs – Red, Green, Yellow
- Female Headers
- 4 pin push button
- PIC holder

2.1.2 Other components and equipment used

- Proto board
- 16F877A Development board
- Multi meter
- Soldering iron, De-soldering sucker and solder wires
- Hot melt glue gun
- Copper plates, FeCl3, Reducer

**3. Results**

- We learn how to use PIC microcontrollers
- We learn about softwares like MPLAB, mikroC

**4. Discussion**

Initially, we figured out the required components for our PCB. Then we make the schematic design and made the PCB. Once all the components were placed we checked it for the functionality. We found some issues in the functionality due to the defects in the PCB. We discussed about the malfunctions among ourselves and finally figured out the defects and made a proper working PCB.

Then we considered about the coding. We discussed about the most effective pattern to shoot the opposing fleet and come up with the checker board pattern. If our shoot is a miss the system will continue the checker board pattern and if it is a hit the system will check the blocks around the hit. We discussed about the ways to place the ships so that the opposite system will not have easy targets.

The problems we faced:

- Issues in the PCB.
- Seven segment display was burnt after soldering it to the PCB
- PIC was burnt several times
- Problems regarding capacitors
- Issues in communicating with the serial port
- Coding errors
- Insufficient memory of the PIC
- **5. Acknowledgements**
- The completion of this project was not an easy task for us. We were novices to all the concepts of PIC microcontroller based projects and we faced a lot of challenges since this is our first such project. First we would like to pay our gratitude to our supervisor Mr. R. T. Wijesekara who always encouraged self-studying and guided us whenever we needed help.
- Also we would like to convey our sincere gratitude to all the lecturers and instructors who were always willing to share their knowledge with us. We are thankful to all the personals in-charge of laboratories and workshop for allowing us to use the instruments and laboratories and also for helping us in technical problems and to all our friends who helped us in various ways.Further, we would like to thank all the people who are not mentioned here for the great support provided.
